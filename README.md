===============================
To play the game, simply open the index.html in your browser, and press the arrows up, left, right, and down to move the player to the water. If the player reaches the water, a winning sound will play and she will be reset. If the player is eaten by a bug, a crash sound will play and the player will be reset so that she can try again. All necessary instructions are on the display page of the game.
